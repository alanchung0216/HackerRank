"In computing, End Of File (commonly abbreviated EOF) is a condition 
in a computer operating system where no more data can be read 
from a data source." â€” (Wikipedia: End-of-file)

The challenge here is to read  lines of input until you reach EOF, 
then number and print all lines of content.

Hint: Java's Scanner.hasNext() method is helpful for this problem.

Input Format

Read some unknown  lines of input from stdin(System.in) until you 
reach EOF; each line of input contains a non-empty String.

Output Format

For each line, print the line number, followed by a single space, 
and then the line content received as input:

k This is the line read as input for line number 'k'.

Sample Input

Hello world
I am a file
Read me until end-of-file.

Sample Output

1 Hello world
2 I am a file
3 Read me until end-of-file.
